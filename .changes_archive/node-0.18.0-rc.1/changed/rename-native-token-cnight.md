# Rename "native-token" to "cnight" for clarity

Partnerchains implements a "Native Token Management" pallet, which is generically named because it's not specific to Midnight. The "Native Token Observation" pallet/inherent data provider was implemented explicitly for cnight, so we've renamed it to reflect that.
