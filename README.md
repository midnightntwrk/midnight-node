[![Nightly Build Status](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-node/actions/workflows/nightly-build-check.yml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=schedule)](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-node/actions/workflows/nightly-build-check.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

# Midnight Node

This is an implementation of the Midnight blockchain. This node houses the Midnight Ledger, allowing participants of Midnight
to come to consensus on the public and their private state.

## Quick Start

If you just want to run midnight-node, the easiest option
is to `git clone https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-node-docker` and run the docker compose script.

## **Note on Open Sourcing Progress**

While this repository is open source, it depends on some repositories
that we are still in the process of being release. As such:

- It's not possible to compile midnight-node independently.
- If you raise a PR, the CI will be able to compile it.
- We're actively working to open-source dependencies in the coming months.

## Development Workflow

Ensure you're using direnv, or source `.envrc` manually.
(For RustRover you can use https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15285-direnv-integration )

Common development commands are kept in the Earthfile prefixed with 'local-'. To see them all, run:

## How-To Guides

### Rebuilding preprod/prod genesis

For `preprod` and `prod` chains, node keys and wallet seeds used in genesis are
stored as secrets.

It's possible to rebuild the chainspecs for `preprod` and `prod` chains without
access to the secrets, since the public keys for the initial authority nodes
are stored in `/res/$NETWORK_NAME/initial-authorities.json`. To rebuild chainspecs without rebuilding the genesis, run:

```shell
$ earthly +rebuild-chainspecs
```

If you need to re-generate the mock file for a `preprod` or `prod` chain, you'll need access to the secrets. These can
be copied from `AWS` into the `/secrets` directory. For example, for testnet these files would be:

```shell
secrets/testnet-seeds-aws.json
secrets/testnet-keys-aws.json
```

The mock file can be regenerated by running:

```shell
$ earthly +generate-keys
# Output: /res/testnet/initial-authorities.json and /res/mock-bridge-data/testnet-mock.json
```

To rebuild the genesis for a preprod environment, copy the keys from `AWS` into the `/secrets` directory and run:

```shell
# secrets copied from /secrets/testnet-02-genesis-seeds.json
$ earthly +rebuild-genesis-testnet-02
```

If you want to regenerate the genesis seeds, run:

```shell
$ earthly +generate-testnet-02-genesis-seeds
```

### How to use transaction generator in the midnight toolkit

### Build Docker images

These are built in CI. See the workflow files for the latest `earthly` commands:

- [node](.github/workflows/main.yml)
- [toolkit](.github/workflows/main.yml)

### Start bootstrapped local network

Start a local network with 5/7 authority node using the existing chain specification `local`

```shell

### How to build runtime in Docker

```shell
earthly +build
cp ./artifacts-amd64/midnight-node-runtime/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/midnight_node_runtime.wasm  .
```

### How to generate node public keys

- For generating single keys:
    - Build node and then run:

```shell
./target/release/midnight-node key generate
```

See the `--help` flag for more information on other arguments, including key schemes.

- For generating multiple keys for bootstrapping:
    - Run the following script to generate $n$ number of key triples and seed phrases. The triples are formatted as
      Rust `enum`s for easy pasting into chain spec files, in the order: `(aura, grandpa, cross_chain)`

```shell
python ./scripts/generate-keys.py --help
```
