# Federated Authority Observation Pallet

A pallet responsible for observing and propagating federated authority changes from the main chain to governance bodies (Council and Technical Committee).

## Overview

This pallet provides mechanisms for observing federated authority membership changes that originate from the main chain and automatically updating the corresponding governance body memberships on the partner chain. It acts as a bridge between the main chain's authority decisions and the partner chain's governance structures.

## Features

- **Inherent-based Updates**: Receives federated authority data through inherents (unsigned transactions)
- **Dual Governance Support**: Manages both Council and Technical Committee memberships
- **Automatic Propagation**: Automatically updates membership pallets when changes are detected
- **Validation**: Ensures member lists meet size constraints and are non-empty
- **Change Detection**: Only creates inherents when actual membership changes occur

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Inherent Provider**: Extracts federated authority data from block inherents
2. **Membership Handlers**: Delegates membership updates to configurable handler types
3. **Change Detection**: Compares incoming authority lists with current state
4. **Event Emission**: Publishes events when memberships are reset
